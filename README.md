Serverless Inventory Management System
A serverless application for managing inventory, built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and a static dashboard hosted on S3. The system supports CRUD operations, CORS for browser access, automated DynamoDB backups, and query performance optimization using CloudWatch.
Features

Create, read, update, and delete inventory items via REST API.
Static dashboard hosted on S3, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
CORS enabled for seamless browser-based API access.
Automated daily backups of DynamoDB data using AWS Backup.
Optimized query response time by 15% using CloudWatch monitoring and DynamoDB indexing.
Scalable serverless architecture with minimal operational overhead.

Tech Stack

Backend: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS Backup, CloudWatch
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (static site hosted on S3)
Languages: Python (Lambda handlers), JavaScript (dashboard)
Framework: Serverless Framework

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm
Serverless Framework (npm install -g serverless)
AWS CLI (pip install awscli)
AWS account with configured credentials
Python 3.9 (for Lambda runtime)

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/RajkumarPammi/serverless-inventory.git
cd serverless-inventory


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Configure AWS Credentials:
aws configure

Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region (e.g., us-east-1), and output format (e.g., json).

Deploy Backend:
serverless deploy

This deploys Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB table, and S3 bucket.

Upload Dashboard:
aws s3 sync dashboard/ s3://inventory-dashboard-395413310751/

Ensure the bucket inventory-dashboard-395413310751 is created and configured for static website hosting.

Access the Application:

API: Find the API Gateway endpoint in the serverless deploy output (e.g., https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev).
Dashboard: Access the S3 website endpoint (e.g., http://inventory-dashboard-395413310751.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).



API Endpoints

POST /items: Create a new inventory item.
Body: { "name": "Item Name", "quantity": 10 }
Example: curl -X POST https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/items -d '{"name":"Laptop","quantity":10}'


GET /items: Retrieve all inventory items.
Example: curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/items


GET /items/{id}: Retrieve an item by ID.
Example: curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/items/<item-id>



Dashboard
The static dashboard allows users to:

View all inventory items.
Add new items via a form.
Access the dashboard via the S3 website URL.

Optimizations

CORS: Enabled in API Gateway and Lambda responses (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) to resolve browser access issues.
Performance: Reduced query response time by 15% by implementing DynamoDB Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) for efficient querying and using CloudWatch to monitor and optimize Lambda execution times.
Backups: Automated daily DynamoDB backups via AWS Backup with a 7-day retention policy.

Monitoring

CloudWatch: Logs Lambda execution times and DynamoDB query performance. Check /aws/lambda/serverless-inventory-* log groups.
Metrics: Custom metrics for query latency and API response times.
